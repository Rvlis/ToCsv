 Following is a summary of the Tribunal¡¯s report ¨C Annex  Introduction  By  notice  dated  6  May  2005  and  an  amendment  notice  dated  17  November 2008, the Financial Secretary required the IDT to institute an inquiry in relation to the listed securities of Founder Holdings Limited to inquire into and determine ¨C  (a)  whether  there  has  been  insider  dealing  in  relation  to  the  company connected with or arising out of the dealings in the listed securities of the company by or on behalf of Julie Kennel, Cheung Shuen Lung, Cheung Siu  Lung,  Yip  Ka  Yeung  Albert,  Peking  University  Founder  Group Corporation  and  Super  Highway  Limited  between  18  May  2001  and 28 August 2001 (both dates inclusive);  (b)  (c) in the event of there having been insider dealing as described in paragraph (a) above, the identity of each and every insider dealer; and the amount of any profit gained or loss avoided as a result of such insider dealing.   The  Tribunal  under  the  chairmanship  of  the  Honourable  Mr  Justice  Saunders completed its inquiry in respect of liability, that is to identify those persons who did or did  not  commit  acts  of  insider  dealing,  and  submitted  a  report  in  that  regard  to  the Financial Secretary on 5 November 2009.   Background Founder  Holdings  Ltd  (Founder)  has  been  listed  on  the  Hong  Kong  Stock Exchange  (HKSE)  since  1995.    The  company,  together  with  its  subsidiaries, (collectively,  ¡°the  Group¡±)  was  principally  engaged  in  the  business  of  the development of computer software, the integration of computer systems, and sales of information products. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Founder was Beijing Founder Order Computer System Company Limited, (Founder Order). As  at  31  December  2000,  Peking  University,  through  a  wholly  owned subsidiary,  Peking  University  Founder  Group  Corporation,  (PUF)  held  393  million shares in Founder, that shareholding constituting 34.01% of the issued share capital of Founder.    PUF was the only substantial shareholder, that is holding more than 10% of the issued share capital in Founder, at that time. In  1998  and  1999  respectively,  Founder  had  recorded  net  losses  of  $165.7 million  and  $223.1  million.    Despite  these  very  substantial  losses  Founder  had returned to profit in 2000, reporting a net profit of $181 million for the calendar year ended 31 December 2000. In the year 2000, the turnover increased from the 1999 year turnover of $1,583 million, to $2,088 million.    The most significant contributor to the increased turnover and  profit  was  the  non-media  sector,  which  comprised  principally  Founder  Order.   The contribution of Founder Order to the gross profit of Founder increased from $50 million in 1999, 25% of the gross profit, to $251,000,000, 58% of the gross profit. At all relevant times Alan Cheung Shuen Lung, (Alan Cheung), was a member of the board of directors of Founder, and held the title of President of the company.   Alan Cheung was based in Hong Kong, and was responsible for overseeing the overall operation  of  Founder,  the  management  of its  overseas  subsidiaries,  and  reporting  on the  business  performance  of  Founder  to  the  board  of  directors.    In  addition,  during the relevant period he was a director of PUF, and held a position as a Research Fellow of  the  Enterprise  Research  Institute  at  Peking  University.    He  was  one  of  the founders  of  the  Group,  and,  according  to  the  2000  annual  report  of  Founder,  had extensive experience in the information technology industry. Founder had a number of subsidiaries in the PRC.    The usual practice was that that  at  monthly,  or  quarterly,  intervals  these  subsidiaries,  including  Founder  Order, would  send  management  accounts  to  Sammy  Fung  who  was  the  Group  Financial Controller, based in Hong Kong.    Sammy Fung would review, adjust and consolidate these  accounts  and  report  to  the  board  of  directors  of  Founder.    If  a  subsidiary  had incurred  unexpected  or  exceptionally  large  losses  Sammy  Fung  would  report  the position to Alan Cheung and the Board of Directors of Founder. On  18  April  2001,  Founder  Order¡¯s  April  2001  accounts,  showing  a  pre-tax loss of $41 million, were sent to Sammy Fung.    On the same day, Sammy Fung sent those  accounts,  by  e-mail,  to  Wang  Hui  Min  in  Beijing,  one  of  Alan  Cheung¡¯s assistants,  and  an  assistant  financial  controller  of  Founder.    Wang  Hui  Min immediately  sent  the  accounts,  by  e-mail,  to  the  executive  directors  of  Founder  in Beijing. On  21  May  2001,  Sammy  Fung  sent  the  Founder  Order  accounts  to  Alan Cheung by e-mail.    On that day a directors meeting was held, at which Alan Cheung was present, to discuss the unexpected loss.   A further meeting was held on 2 June 2001, at which Alan Cheung, Wei Xin, a Founder  director  based  in  Beijing,  and  two  directors  of  Founder  Order  met  the four-month result of Founder Order.    Also discussed in the meeting was the Founder Order  target  for  the  first  six  months  of  2001,  which  was  to  achieve  a  turnover  of RMB140  million,  with  a  gross  profit  of  30%  and  a  profit  of  RMB10  million.   Against that forecast, Founder Order was showing a loss of RMB41 million after the six months. Sammy Fung received the management accounts of Founder Order for the first six months of 2001 on Friday 13 July 2001.    He forwarded that information to both Wei  Xin  and  Alan  Cheung  on  the  afternoon  of  Monday  16  July  2001.    Those management accounts revealed an unaudited operating loss of RMB61 million. Before trading on the HKSE commenced on 28 August 2001, Founder issued a profit warning (the 1st Announcement), stating that it expected to record a substantial loss for the six months ended 30 June 2001.    After the release of that announcement, Founder¡¯s share price plunged 18.52%, from $1.35, to close at $1.10 on that day.    On the  same  day,  the  Heng  Seng  Index  (HSI)  rose  slightly,  by  66  points,  or  0.6%,  to 11,301. The next two days saw a further reduction in the share price, by 14.6% on 29 August  2001,  to  $0.94,  and  by  4.3%  on  30  August  2001  to  $0.90.    On  29 August 2001, the HSI rose by 59 points, and on 30 August 2001, it dropped 74 points. Newspaper  reports  on  30  August  2001,  speculating  that  the  loss  suffered  by Founder  for  the  first  half-year  would  be  in  the  order  of  RMB100  million  excited  a further  announcement  (the  2nd  Announcement)  from  the  board  of  Founder  on  31 August 2001. Notwithstanding  occasional  share  price  rebounds,  the  Founder  share  price continued  to  fall,  closing  at  $0.68  on  14  September  2001,  down  24.4%  from  the closing  price  on  30  August  2001.    In  that  same  period,  the  HSI  fell  by  17.9%  to 9,308 points.    It is worthy of note that on the basis of the published accounts for the year 2000, Founder¡¯s net asset value (NAV) was $0.68. On  the  morning  of  19  September  2001,  Founder  published  its  interim  results for the six months ended 30 June 2001.    These revealed a net loss of $119.8 million, compared with a net profit of $51 million for the same period the year before.    Upon publication  of  that  information  the  share  price  rose  5.9%  to  close  at  $0.72,  the  HSI rising by 2.7% to close at 9,558.    Notwithstanding that price rise, the closing price of Founder shares at the end of trading on 19 September 2001, was 27.7% lower than the re-rated price of $0.996 following the profit warning announcement. Alan  Cheung  is  closely  related  to  a  number  of  persons  who,  personally,  or through entities controlled by them, dealt in Founder shares during the relevant period, i.e. the period between 18 April 2001, on which day Sammy Fung had sent Founder Order¡¯s  four  months  accounts  to  Alan  Cheung¡¯s  assistant,  Wang  Hui  Min,  and  28 August 2001, the day on which the 1st Announcement was published. Julie  Kennel  was  Alan  Cheung¡¯s  sister-in-law.    Between  April  2000  and October 2000, she had accumulated 3,844,000 shares in Founder.    Between the end of  October  2000  and  3  May  2001,  there  were  no  movements  at  all  within  Julie Kennel¡¯s share broking account.    On 3 May 2001, 500,000 shares from the account were  sold  at  $2.15.    On  26  July  2001,  the  remaining  3,344,000  shares  were  sold  at prices ranging from $1.73 to $1.77. Super Highway Ltd, (Super Highway), is a company incorporated in the British Virgin  Islands,  (BVI).    The  sole  shareholder  and  director  of  Super  Highway  during the relevant period was Mdm Liu, who is the sister-in-law of Alan Cheung¡¯s younger brother, S L Cheung. Between 10 March 2000, and 19 September 2000, through the various accounts, Super  Highway  had  accumulated  64,898,000  shares  in  Founder.    In  October  2000, Super Highway made a net disposal of 1,978,000 shares in Founder.    Subsequently, trading  in  Founder  shares  by  Super  Highway  became  less  active,  and  between  1 November  2000,  and  17  May  2001  only  100,000  shares  were  bought,  and  618,250 shares were sold.    Consequently, by 17 May 2001, Super Highway held 62,401,750 shares in Founder. Between 22 May 2001 and 21  August  2001,  Super  Highway  sold  10,818,000 Founder  shares.    During  that  period,  on  three  occasions  only,  Super  Highway acquired  Founder  shares.    Those  acquisitions,  totalling  686,000  shares  were  on  20 June  2001,  336,000  shares,  on  the  same  day  164,000  shares  were  sold;  on  28  June 2001 300,000 shares were acquired, and on 9 July 2001 50,000 shares were acquired.   The proceeds of sales was $17,518,881.02. S L Cheung used Super Highway¡¯s share trading accounts to deal in Founder shares on a personal basis.    Between 15 June 2001 and 7 August 2001, S L Cheung bought 280,000 Founder shares, and sold 2,190,000 Founder shares, a net disposal of 1,910,000 shares.    Acquisitions were  made on  15  June  2001,  of  200,000  shares,  27 July 2001, of 20,000 shares, and 3 August 2000 of 60,000 shares.    Instructions for all acquisitions  and  disposals  were  placed  by  Mdm  Liu,  on  the  instructions  of  S  L Cheung.    The sale proceeds from the disposal of shares totalled $3,992,086.23. PUF,  of  which  Alan  Cheung  was  a  director,  also  traded  in  Founder  Shares during the relevant period.    PUF held a share broking account with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (Morgan Stanley).    There were four signatories to the account, including S L Cheung and Albert Yip, who was also Alan Cheung¡¯s brother-in-law.    Between 20  July  2001  and  16  August  2001,  on  the  instructions  of  Albert  Yip,  PUF  sold 5,150,000 shares.    The sale proceeds from these disposals totalled $7,941,597.13.   It  was  alleged  that  before  Founder¡¯s  announcement  on  28  August  2001,  the profit warning stating that it expected to record a substantial loss for the six months ended  30  June  2001,  some  parties  had  taken  advantage  of  the  relevant  information they possessed to deal, counsel or procure another person(s) to deal in Founder shares, thus constituting insider dealing.  Findings The Tribunal concluded that it had not been established that there was insider dealing in respect of the listed securities of Founder by or on behalf of Julie Kennel, Cheung  Shuen  Lung,  Cheung  Siu  Lung,  Yip  Ka  Yeung  Albert,  Peking  University Founder  Group  Corporation  or  Super  Highway  Limited  between  18 May  2001  and 28 August 2001.
